# elixir-euler

This repo is literally for me to try out Elixir. If you've stumbled upon this, I wouldn't recommend even using this as a good example of what to do. It's messy, it's sloppy, the comments are bad. But it's all so I can practice and get better with Elixir.

And you know what, it's honestly just fun!
